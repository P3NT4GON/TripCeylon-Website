### Guide for PHP files :elephant:

PHP files with the word 'add' are the pages that only have access to admins. 

In those pages, admins can create new data,view the data which users added and delete data

PHP files with the word 'connect' are the pages that connect pages with database.

Rest of the pages are the normal user pages which have a connection with the database.
